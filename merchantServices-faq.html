                                        <p>Yes. It's a fact: using cards to make payments is the No1 choice for the majority
                                            of your existing and potential customers. Most consumers and businesses simply
                                            expect to be able to use cards to pay for their goods and services. Taking card
                                            payments means you can benefit from the total payment market opportunity, rather
                                            than just restricting your business to the amount of cash that your customer's
                                            have in their pocket.

                                        <p>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard The PCI Data Security Standard represents
                                            a common set of industry tools and measurements to help ensure the safe handling

                                        <p>The PCI Security Standards Council encourages all businesses that store payment account
                                            data to comply with the PCI DSS to help lower the brand and financial risks associated

                                            institutions, we also must perform due diligence by verifying a customer's identity
                                            and, if necessary, monitoring transactions for suspicious activity. This is often
                                            termed as KYC -- "know your customer." This means, to begin with, knowing the
                                            identity of the customers, and further, understanding the transactions and businesses
                                            the customers do.</p>
